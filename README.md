# stl-next-flow-2

Here we make PRs to next, with a running release-please release-pr job on next. We disable labeling the PR because we have to open our own PR to main and label it with `autorelease: pending`.  

You can use [this link](https://github.com/devdoshi/stl-next-flow-2/compare/main...release-please--branches--next--components--my-package) to start a PR from the running release branch to main

When commits are made to main, we rebase next onto main.
